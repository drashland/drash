# Tests / Middleware / Deno

## Configuring TypeScript

This directory depends on you having:

- the official Deno extension installed; and
- `<this-project-root-dir>/.vscode/settings.json` file with the following configurations at a minimum:

  ```json
  {
    "deno.enable": true,
    "deno.enablePaths": [
      "./tests/middleware/deno"
    ]
  }
  ```
